      <h2 class="section-title">Hiring Essentials</h2>
      <p class="text">The nice thing about beginning hiking is that you don't really need any special gear, you can probably get away with things you already have. Let's start with clothing. A typical mistake hiking beginners makeis wearing jeans and regular clothes, which will get heavy and chafe if they get sweaty or wet.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Understand Your Map & Timing</h2>
      <p class="text">To start, print out the hiking guide and map. If it's raining, throw them in a Zip-Lock bag. Read over the guide, study the map, and have a good idea of what to expect. I like to know what my next landmark is as I hike. For example, I'll read the guide and know that say, in a mile, I make a right turn at the junction..</p>
